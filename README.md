## Foreword
The 3 volumes of the continuous learning trilogy provide a practical synthesis on the best practices I gained as Trainer and Product Owner (P.O) of web application in the Media industry.  

- Book #1: The good and small "Zambian" guide for WordPress. How to run a News Website with WordPress?

- Book #2:  Defining a testing automation strategy for a P.O. with CODECEPTION_ & WordPress

- Book #3: Redefining a testing automation strategy for a P.O. with CodeceptJS & WordPress

1.  The Book #1 gathers all the materials that I brought with me to deliver a training session in Zambia to a team of journalists from the domestic network ZNBC on how to manage and run a news website. I made as intuitive and operational as possible. It has been transposed mostly to WordPress so anyone can leverage on it. It entails good practices under constraints such as budget, technical environment and team resources.

2.  The Book #2 & Book #3 present my understanding and practical experience of web application testing that I gained as Product Owner (P.O) in the Media industry. In these two books, I focus on user acceptance testing that is one of the biggest challenges for a PO of a large web application (back office, website).  How to minimize the risks of the acceptance phase?  How to master its duration? How to avoid regressions and side effects. Book #2 & Book #3 aim at answering those questions with the help of CP (Codeception) and CPJS (CodeceptJS).

## Acknowledgments

For book #2 & book #3, after a quick benchmark of the market solutions and the constraints that were mine, I totally relied on Codeception and CodeceptJS. I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank to the Codeception (CP) and CodeceptJS (CPJS) team's excellent work and the remarkable documentation that accompanies it. Without this documentation, I believe that I would not have taken such a step.

## Book Introduction

**Ignorant I was :)**

I must admit it: I have been slow to recognize the value of testing. As Product Owner (P.O) of a large project of backoffice for a News website, I found testing disappointing and useless. 
1. I did not see any significant impact of testing on software quality.

2. I thought tests were boring, time-consuming, expensive without immediate R.O.I

3. I did not find so far a tool that allows you to launch an ambitious testing strategy with a clear visibility on criteria like cost, ability to perform all types of test (unitary, functional and UAT),a good documentation, support from a mature development community, technical prerequisites etc.


As a result, I preferred manual testing procedure, based on a google doc or excel sheet. But I was wrong!  

**Tests are useful, incredibly time saving for a P.O. It strengthens confidence for the all team into a project. It can even be possibly cool. What an irony!**

And this book is the consequence of my “awaking” ;-)


## Code
**I try not to forget anything. The best thing to do is to make a fresh installation of CodeCeption (CP), finalize the configuration and then cut and paste the testing files one after the other with a WP running on custom URL in MAMP.**
